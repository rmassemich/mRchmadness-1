#' Simulate the full bracket starting with an empty bracket
#'
#' @param bracket.empty a length-64 character vector giving the field of 64
#'   teams in the tournament, in order of initial overall seeding
#' @param prob.matrix a matrix of probabilities, with rows and columns
#'   corresponding to teams, matching the output of bradley.terry().
#'   If NULL, prob.source is used.
#' @param prob.source source from which to use round probabilities for
#'   simulation --- "pop": ESPN's population of picks (default),
#'   "kenpom": Ken Pomeroy's predictions (kenpom.com), or
#'   "538": predictions form fivethirtyeight.com.
#'   Ignored if prob.matrix is specified.
#' @param league which league: "men" (default) or "women", for prob.source.
#'   Ignored if prob.matrix is specified.
#' @param year year of tournament, used for prob.source.
#'   Ignored if prob.matrix is specified.
#' @param home.teams character vector of names of teams to whom home-team bias
#'   is to be applied (must match name column of pred.pop.[league].[year]).
#'   Ignored unless prob.source is "pop" (see ?add.home.bias for details).
#' @param num.reps number of simulations to perform (default is 1)
#' @return a 63-by-num.reps matrix storing the simulation outcome, each
#'   column encoding the outcome for a single simulation in the following
#'   order: seeds 1 through 32 after round 1, seeds 1 through 16 after round 2,
#'   seeds 1 through 8 after round 3, seeds 1 through 4 after round 4,
#'   seeds 1 and 2 after round 5, and finally seed 1 after round 6 (the
#'   champion)
